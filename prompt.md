You can see the repo. It was for gme api interaction. I will use this library in another project. 
Therefore, we need to implement these things :

1. Fetch data from gme. If it is encoded, we need to decode it. 
2. We need to play with data. Italian energy market data may be very complex as there are many regions etc. 
3. All output should be stored as csv files. 
4. My aim is to use this data in my xgboost model. But don't forget, this library is just for data fetching. Thereshould me nothing about xgboost in this repo. 
5. Check the environment. There might be dummy files because I did some experiment in this repo so far.
6. You can clean some dummy codes. 
7. Don't forget commit regularly. You can reach mcp server.
